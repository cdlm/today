# _today_ — a productivity tracker

[Today][home] is a command-line journal manager written in [Ruby][]. It allows you to quickly record small text entries, then recall stored entries using time-based queries (mainly). My main use-case is easily recalling what I did at the weekly standup meeting, and making my progress a bit more tangible.

There are many similar tools, but this is an area where preference sort of matters, and I didn't find one that really matched what I want. Also I wanted to write a decent Ruby program from scratch. _$MORE_EXCUSES_
